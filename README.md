Scenario: 
You are working as a Customer Service Team Lead in a German company called “Küchen-Kalle” which sells kitchen supplies. For decades, Küchen-Kalle solely relied on selling their products physically in stores, but recently they started building up their own e-commerce business.

This is their current MarTech Stack:

WordPress Website
Shopify Shop system
LiveChat Chatbot
Google Analytics
Google Tag Manager
Google Ads, Bing Ads
Pipedrive
Cookiebot CMP
Facebook company profile
Google Workspace Suite
Usually, marketing analytics, and especially Google Analytics is not your day-to-day business at Küchen-Kalle, but the colleague that monitors the company’s Google Analytics account and is the marketing team’s go-to person for web performance-related questions got sick. 

Your colleagues know that you have expertise in marketing analytics which is why a co-worker from the marketing department approaches you and asks for help.

The colleague tells you that they receive an automated Google Analytics report every month. The current one for April which they’ve received on May 1, shows a big drop in revenue measured in Google Analytics last month. The marketing team can’t figure out why this happened and needs your support.

Task:
Identify the potential reason(s) for the drop and present your findings by using data story telling!
